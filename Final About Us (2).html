    <h2>Who are we</h2>
    <p>Paws and Vibes Collective (PnVC) is a cool shop that was started in 2025 for people who love dogs and want the best for them. We sell all kinds of dog products like fun toys, yummy treats, comfy beds, and even stylish collars. Our goal is to help dogs live happy, healthy lives while also making their owners smile. We first opened a small store in a busy area, and now we also have a website so people from all over South Africa can shop with us. At PnVC, we care a lot about pets, and we choose everything in our store carefully to make sure it’s safe and good quality. We want every customer and their dog to feel welcome and excited when they visit us. For us, dogs aren’t just pets  they’re part of the family, and we’re here to make sure they’re treated that way.</p>

  <h2>Our History?</h2>
    <p>PnVC started in 2025 because more and more people were getting dogs and wanted cool, good quality stuff for them. The owners saw that people treat their dogs like part of the family, so they decided to open a store that sells fun, safe, and stylish dog products. At first, PnVC was just a small shop in a busy shopping area. But as more dog lovers came and told their friends, the store became more popular. That’s when the team decided to also sell online so that people from all over South Africa could shop for their pets. Since then, PnVC has kept growing and is now known for having awesome products and friendly service. It all started with a simple idea: dogs deserve the best!!!</p>
